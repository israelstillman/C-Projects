# The item tracking program for the Corner Grocer is a C++ implementation that assists in analyzing daily sales records and optimizing the layout of their produce section.  The program starts by processing a text file containing item records and creates an ItemTracker object to store and track item frequencies.  The user is presented with a menu offering different options including: searching for an item, displaying the item list, displaying the item list in the form of a histogram, and exiting the program.

# By creating multiple functions for the different menu options, it allowed for a concise main function and in turn enhancing program readability.  The most challenging part of creating this program was creating a constructor to read item frequencies from the input file.  With the help of some online resouces and past course readings I was able to overcome this challenge.  The skills exemplified in this program such as reading information from an input file, creating functions outside of main, and outputting files to a backup file can easily be transferred to future projects.  The utilization of a .txt file allows for easy program maintainability and adaptability.
